## Thoughts

The Nest Mini is a glorified TV remote. It seems to have an issue with my pronunciation of English and Dutch words and sentences. At times, I'm left to reiterate my request several times in a row and defaulting back to the TV remote. If anything, it infuriates me more than it adds value to my life.

The Amazon Echo is more versatile. It has a built-in temperature sensor, a Zigbee-hub (which link up with my Ikea smart lights), and integrates nicely with my Tapo P115 smart plugs. As a speaker, it performs nicely.  Unfortunately, it does not integrate with my Android TV at all. 

The phone app for both devices (Google Home & Alexa) makes you wonder whether any UI-designer was involved in building it. Considering I have to traverse several menus to see my living room temperature, I doubt it.

Another annoyance with the Amazon Echo is that it does not integrate with my Android TV at all. The infuriating part is that Amazon's own Fire TV line up is based on Android. I realize there are technical details I'm skipping, but there is no technical reason why the Echo is incapable of controlling an Android TV. Some TV manufactures provide skills for Alexa, unfortunately, Philips restricts access to its Alexa skill (and features) to geographical areas - in which I'm not.

I haven't played music on either the Nest Mini or the Echo while measuring their power consumption.
